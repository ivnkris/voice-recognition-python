# Speech Recognition Script - Python

## Description

In this project I have created a speech recognition script using Google Web Speech API to connect to the user's microphone and print the transcript of the recorded audio onto the command line.

## Getting started

To install dependencies run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you are a mac user, you also need to install PortAudio for this to work, so run:
`brew install portaudio`
